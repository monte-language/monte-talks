Cryptographic Sealing

This example features bindings to `libsodium` to create a relatively compact
single-file encryption tool, based on `libsodium` boxes.

The `<-` syntax turns calls into eventual sends, which will result in deferred
computation. Like `when` expressions, eventual sends are executed sometime
after the computation that prepares them.

`switch` expressions perform pattern-matching against a sequence of patterns.
Here, the specimen `argv`, representing command-line arguments, is
deconstructed into an operation and positional parameters.
