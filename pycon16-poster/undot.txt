"Undot" Algorithm

This short and sweet algorithm was made up on the fly to decode
Tahoe-LAFS-style JSON maps, which have this "dotted" naming scheme. Like all
of these examples, this algorithm was first written in Monte, and then
translated by hand to Python. Monte's pattern-matching and immutable data
structures make this algorithm easy to read.
