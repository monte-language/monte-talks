Cube Root

A straightforward application of Newton's method retrieves reasonably-accurate
cube roots. Since Python and Monte both use IEEE 754 double-precision
floating-point numbers, the same algorithm computes the same results in both
languages. (Including the buggy behavior on extremely large input values.)
